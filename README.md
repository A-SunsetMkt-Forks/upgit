*Upgit* helps you simply upload any file to your Github repository and then get a raw URL for it.

This is also useful with [Typora](https://typora.io/) as an image uploader.

## Get started

### Download

Download it from [Release](https://github.com/pluveto/upgit/releases).

> If you have no idea which to download:
>
> + For most Windows users, choose `upgit_win_amd64.exe`
> + For most macOS users, choose `upgit_macos_arm64.exe`

Rename it to `upgit` (For Windows users, `upgit.exe`), save it to somewhere you like.

**Warning: ** this program doesn't contain an auto-updater. If you need to keep updated, just give *upgit* a ‚≠ê<u>star</u>.

### Config

Create `config.toml` in the same directory of *upgit*, and fill it in following [this sample config file](https://github.com/pluveto/upgit/blob/main/config.sample.toml).

### Use it

To upload file `demo.png`, execute:

```shell
./upgit demo.png
# for windows: .\upgit.exe demo.png
```

Then you'll see a link to `demo.png`.



For help, type `-h` argument

```
./upgit -h
Usage: upgit.exe [--verbose] PATHS [PATHS ...]

Positional arguments:
  PATHS

Options:
  --verbose              verbosity level
  --help, -h             display this help and exit
```

### Use it for Typora

> Assuming your *upgit* program is saved at `"C:\repo\upgit\upgit.exe"`.

Select *File > Preferences...*

Here is a sample config file:

```toml
branch = "master"
pat = "ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
rename = "{year}/{month}/upgit_{year}{month}{day}_{unix_ts}{ext}"
repo = "repo-name"
username = "username"
